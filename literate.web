;; Literate Programming
;; ====================
;; I just finished reading Donald Knuth's articles on Literate
;; Programming (TODO: Add Reference), and found the idea quite
;; inspiring. While I find the core idea sound, I have some issues
;; with the tools available.
;;
;; * The base language is Pascal (TODO: Add Reference) (and later C
;;   (TODO: Add Reference)), but I generally would prefer to work in a
;;   variant of Lisp.
;; * The documentation language is TeX (TODO: Add Reference), which I
;;   find less intuitive to write in than Markdown.
;; * The constructs that exist in existing tools remain rooted in
;;   procedural programming, while my style is decidedly more
;;   functional.
;;
;; One thing a reader may notice is that I'm using names already
;; claimed by existing tools. I spent some time trying to think of new
;; names, but they were all stupid or were already used. Instead of
;; spinning my wheels on that, I decided to just reuse the existing
;; name. This could be considered a problem if I this were intended
;; for a broad audience, but I'm making this just for me (TODO: Insert
;; link).
;;
;; Roadmap
;; =======
;; The technique I'm using to bootstrap this project is to start by
;; narrating the code entirely in comments. I will then mutate the
;; commentary using features as I write them. Here's what I still have
;; left to implement:
;;
;; * Exclude anything outside of a ```...``` block
;; * Allow function name substitution
;; * Add the weave command
;; * Write the markdown generator
;; * Accept file name as script argument
;;
;; Each version of the script will be used to generate the subsequent
;; version. Unlike the other files in this project, though, the
;; generated code file will be committed to the repository. That way,
;; the new version can be built without needing to step through all
;; versions of the code.
;;
;; I'm eventually planning on building my own version of lisp. As a
;; result, I'm tolerating several compromises that will eventually
;; need to be corrected. Documenting them here as a reminder for when
;; that is completed.
;;
;; * An invalid version of `web` can be created, which could present
;;   an intractible situation.
;; * Because `web` is writing to itself while open, clisp prints a
;;   warning.
;; * Calling `chmod` instead of manipulating the permission directly.
;;
;; Commands
;; ========
;; There will be two commands for this script: `tangle` and
;; `weave`. Tangling interleaves the code in an executable order,
;; while weaving parses the file as markdown and generates an html
;; file.
;;
;; Extracting the command is as simple as checking the beginning of
;; `*args*`. I went ahead and introduced error handling here, although
;; the single command the script accepts at this point makes the other
;; half of that condition rather pointless. Eventually the function
;; for the tangle logic will be called from within this `cond`, but
;; not worrying about that until I can interleave code.

(setq command (car *args*))
(cond ((string= command "tangle") '(tangle logic))
      (t (error (concatenate 'string "invalid command: " command))))

;; Tangle
;; ------
;; For now, I'm leaving the `tangle` command as implicit, this is to
;; keep the program simple and focus it on a single feature. All we're
;; doing in this early version of the code is reading the entire file
;; and writing it to a new file called `web`.

(let ((in (open "literate.web"))
      (out (open "web" :direction :output :if-exists :supersede)))
  (write-line "#!/usr/bin/clisp" out)
  (loop for line = (read-line in nil)
	while line do (write-line line out))
  (close in))

;; The file needs to be executable. Shelling out leaves a bad taste in
;; my mouth I'll eventually need to fix, but for now I'll tolerate it.

(shell "chmod a+x web")
